        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The goal of this project is to analyze rainfall and runoff on the St. Paul Campus at the University of Minnesota. FEMA receives the most requests for aid due to flood damage in Minnesota, therefore it is important to be able to manage and prepare for storms of varying sizes. In this spatial analysis four storm levels will be modeled to support University management in addressing flooding issues that impact campus.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Storm Levels</h3>
        <br>
        <h4> 1/4" 1" 2" 4"</h4>
        <br>
        <h4> Objective One</h4>
        <p>Develop data through in situ field collection, digitization, and the creation of an analysis workflow. This model will be used to calculate storm water volumes for features on campus, such as storm sewers, catch basins, and surface sinks.</p>
        <h4>Objective Two</h4>
        <p>Provide a set of modifications to mitigate excess storm water for each storm level. Possible modifications include the addition of canopy, replacing pavement with permeable pavement, rain gardens or surface sinks, altering rooftops, and adding underground storage. All of these modification types and specifications can be seen in further detail in the Modification section.</p>
